# Team Score Implementation Plan

## Overview

Adding a comprehensive Team Score section after "Top Contributors" to evaluate team effectiveness based on commit data and collaboration patterns.

## Team Effectiveness Metrics Design

### 1. Collaboration Metrics (30% weight)

- **Code Review Participation**: Percentage of commits through pull requests vs direct commits
- **Cross-Pollination Index**: How often team members work on files touched by others
- **Knowledge Sharing Score**: Distribution of file ownership (balanced vs siloed)
- **Co-authorship Rate**: Frequency of pair programming and collaborative commits

### 2. Consistency & Velocity (25% weight)

- **Team Velocity Consistency**: Standard deviation of commit frequency across team
- **Bus Factor**: Risk assessment of knowledge concentration
- **Active Contributor Ratio**: Percentage of contributors active in recent period
- **Delivery Cadence**: Regularity of team contributions over time

### 3. Code Quality & Governance (25% weight)

- **Team Governance Score**: Average commit message quality across team
- **Refactoring Activity**: Percentage of commits dedicated to code improvement
- **Bug Fix Ratio**: Balance between feature work and maintenance
- **Documentation Contribution**: Team investment in documentation

### 4. Work-Life Balance & Sustainability (20% weight)

- **Work Pattern Health**: Distribution of commit times (healthy vs concerning patterns)
- **Overtime Frequency**: Percentage of after-hours and weekend commits
- **Vacation Coverage**: Team's ability to maintain velocity during absences
- **Burnout Risk Indicators**: Detection of unsustainable work patterns

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Team Score Interface to Types

- Define `TeamScore` interface with metrics and scoring
- Add team-level aggregation functions

### Step 2: Extend Analyzer with Team Calculations

- Implement team metric calculations in `GitAnalyzer`
- Add team score to `AnalysisReport` interface

### Step 3: Update HTML Output

- Add Team Score section after Top Contributors
- Create visualizations for team metrics
- Implement interactive charts for team performance

### Step 4: Add CSS Styling

- Design team score dashboard layout
- Add progress bars and metric cards
- Ensure responsive design

## Team Score Algorithm

### Overall Team Score (0-100)

```
TeamScore = (Collaboration * 0.30) + (Consistency * 0.25) + (Quality * 0.25) + (Balance * 0.20)
```

### Scoring Thresholds

- 90-100: Excellent (High-performing team)
- 75-89: Good (Healthy team dynamics)
- 60-74: Fair (Room for improvement)
- 40-59: Poor (Concerning patterns)
- 0-39: Critical (Immediate attention needed)

## Recommendations Engine

Based on team score components, provide actionable recommendations:

- Collaboration improvements
- Process optimization suggestions
- Work-life balance adjustments
- Knowledge sharing initiatives

## Implementation Timeline

1. Define interfaces and types (30 min)
2. Implement team calculation logic (60 min)
3. Add HTML section and visualizations (45 min)
4. Testing and refinement (30 min)

Total estimated time: 2.5 hours
