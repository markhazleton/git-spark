  - Dynamic badges for teamDynamics, maturityLevel, sustainabilityRating
  - Insight grids categorizing strengths, improvements, and risks
  - All subjective team interpretation content

#### Removed Governance & Code Quality Section  

- **Lines ~705-720**: Complete removal of the governance section containing:
  - Governance metric cards (conventional commits, traceability, message length)
  - WIP commits, reverts, short messages metrics
  - Governance chart container and visualizations

#### Additional Cleanup

- **Line 17**: Updated file header comment from "Governance scoring and commit patterns" to "Repository activity and contribution patterns"
- **Line 340**: Removed `governancePct` variable calculation
- **Line 367**: Removed governance metric from key metrics array
- **Line 411**: Removed governance reference from SVG banner
- **Line 491**: Removed governance from social media metadata
- **Line 512**: Removed governance navigation link
- **Line 535**: Removed governance score display from header
- **Lines 734-750**: Removed outdated "Code Quality & Governance" documentation section
- **Unused Functions**: Removed pctFmt helper function that was no longer used

### 2. Test Suite Updates (`test/html-exporter.test.ts`)

#### Fixed Test Expectations

- **Line 242**: Removed expectation for 'Governance & Code Quality' section
- **Line 245**: Removed expectation for 'governanceChart' element
- Maintained tests for 'Risk Overview' and 'riskFactorsChart' which remain in the report

## Build & Test Verification

### Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Version incremented to 1.0.70
- ✅ No lint errors or compilation issues

### Test Results

- ✅ All 181 tests passing
- ✅ 12 test suites passing  
- ✅ HTML exporter tests specifically verified
- ✅ No failing assertions or broken functionality

### Report Generation

- ✅ HTML report generation working correctly
- ✅ No governance sections visible in output
- ✅ Navigation links properly updated
- ✅ Social media metadata cleaned up
- ✅ All subjective content successfully removed

## Impact Assessment

### What Was Removed

1. **Team Dynamics Section**: All subjective team insights, maturity ratings, and interpretive content
2. **Governance & Code Quality Section**: All governance scoring, commit message quality analysis, and code quality metrics
3. **Associated References**: Navigation links, metadata, variables, and documentation
4. **Unused Code**: Helper functions and calculations no longer needed

### What Remains Objective

1. **Repository Statistics**: Commit counts, author counts, file changes
2. **Risk Analysis**: Objective file hotspots and churn metrics  
3. **Author Profiles**: Factual contribution data without subjective scoring
4. **Timeline Data**: Historical commit patterns and activity
5. **File Analysis**: Code hotspots based on quantifiable metrics

## User Value Delivered

### ✅ Objectives Achieved

- **Complete Objectivity**: HTML reports now contain only Git-data-derived facts
- **Trust Building**: All subjective interpretations removed as requested
- **Data Defensibility**: Every metric can be traced directly to Git commit history
- **Clean UX**: Seamless removal without broken functionality or navigation

### ✅ Quality Maintained

- **Consistent Build Process**: All builds successful with no regressions
- **Test Coverage**: Full test suite passing with updated expectations
- **Documentation**: Accurate documentation reflecting current functionality
- **User Experience**: Clean, professional reports without subjective bias

## Technical Notes

### HTML Template Architecture

The HTML template structure remains robust with proper:

- Responsive design maintained
- Chart.js visualizations working for objective metrics
- Accessibility features preserved (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- CSP security headers intact
- Dark/light theme functionality preserved

### Future Considerations

- All governance-related data structures remain in the core analysis for potential future use
- Only the HTML presentation layer was modified to remove subjective content
- Other export formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown) retain full data for programmatic access
- HTML report now focuses on objective, quantifiable Git repository metrics

## Session Outcome

✅ **COMPLETE SUCCESS**: HTML reports are now fully objective and defendable, containing only Git-data-derived facts without any subjective interpretations or governance scoring. The user's requirement for "fully defendable" reporting has been achieved through the complete removal of all subjective content from the HTML output format.
