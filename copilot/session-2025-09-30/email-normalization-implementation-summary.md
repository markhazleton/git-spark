# Email Normalization and Author Merging Implementation Summary

## Session Overview

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Focus:** Implement case-insensitive email normalization and merge authors with the same email address in HTML reports

## User Requirement

> "for html report detailed author section force lower case for author email and combine where email is the same except for case"

This requirement addresses the common issue where the same person commits using different email address cases (e.g., "<John.Doe@Example.COM>" vs "<john.doe@example.com>").

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Email Merging Function

**Location:** `src/output/html.ts`

Added `mergeAuthorsByEmail()` method that:

- Normalizes all email addresses to lowercase
- Merges authors with identical normalized emails
- Combines commit statistics (commits, insertions, deletions, churn)
- Uses earliest first commit and latest last commit dates
- Merges detailed metrics when available
- Prefers descriptive names over email addresses

**Key Algorithm:**

```typescript
private mergeAuthorsByEmail(authors: any[]): any[] {
  const emailMap = new Map<string, any>();
  
  for (const author of authors) {
    const normalizedEmail = author.email.toLowerCase();
    
    if (emailMap.has(normalizedEmail)) {
      const existing = emailMap.get(normalizedEmail)!;
      // Merge commit statistics
      existing.commits += author.commits;
      existing.insertions += author.insertions;
      existing.deletions += author.deletions;
      existing.churn += author.churn;
      // ... additional merging logic
    } else {
      const normalizedAuthor = { ...author, email: normalizedEmail };
      emailMap.set(normalizedEmail, normalizedAuthor);
    }
  }
  
  return Array.from(emailMap.values());
}
```

### 2. Integration Points

**Author Table Generation:**

- Modified author table generation to use merged authors
- Ensures consistent email linking between table and detailed profiles
- Maintains proper sorting and display of combined statistics

**Detailed Author Profiles:**

- Updated `generateDetailedAuthorProfiles()` to apply merging
- All author profile cards now show normalized lowercase emails
- Profile IDs generated from normalized emails for consistent linking

### 3. Merging Logic Details

**Commit Statistics Merging:**

- `commits`: Sum of all commits
- `insertions`: Sum of all insertions
- `deletions`: Sum of all deletions
- `churn`: Sum of total churn
- `filesChanged`: Maximum files changed (preserves highest impact)
- `avgCommitSize`: Recalculated as churn/commits

**Time Range Merging:**

- `firstCommit`: Earliest date across all instances
- `lastCommit`: Latest date across all instances

**Name Preference Logic:**

- Prefers names that don't contain '@' symbols
- Uses longer, more descriptive names
- Avoids using email addresses as display names when better options exist

**Detailed Metrics Merging:**

- Combines contribution metrics when available
- Preserves work patterns from the instance with more data
- Handles null/undefined detailed metrics gracefully

### 4. Test Coverage

**New Test:** `merges authors with same email address (case-insensitive)`

Verifies:

- ✅ Only one author profile generated for duplicate emails
- ✅ Email displayed in lowercase format
- ✅ Original mixed-case emails not present in output
- ✅ Combined commit statistics displayed correctly
- ✅ Descriptive name preferred over email address

## Example Behavior

### Before Implementation

```html
<!-- Two separate author profiles -->
<div class="author-profile-card" id="author-John-Doe-Example-COM">
  <h3>John Doe</h3>
  <span class="author-email">John.Doe@Example.COM</span>
  <div class="metric-value">10</div> <!-- commits -->
</div>

<div class="author-profile-card" id="author-john-doe-example-com">
  <h3>john.doe@example.com</h3>
  <span class="author-email">john.doe@example.com</span>
  <div class="metric-value">5</div> <!-- commits -->
</div>
```

### After Implementation

```html
<!-- Single merged author profile -->
<div class="author-profile-card" id="author-john-doe-example-com">
  <h3>John Doe</h3>
  <span class="author-email">john.doe@example.com</span>
  <div class="metric-value">15</div> <!-- combined commits -->
</div>
```

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits

- ✅ **Consistent Identity:** Same person appears as single author
- ✅ **Accurate Statistics:** Combined metrics provide true contribution picture
- ✅ **Clean Display:** Lowercase emails ensure consistent presentation
- ✅ **Better Navigation:** Links work consistently between table and profiles
- ✅ **Reduced Confusion:** Eliminates duplicate author entries

### Maintained Functionality

- ✅ All existing HTML report features preserved
- ✅ Author table sorting and filtering intact
- ✅ Profile card layout and styling unchanged
- ✅ Navigation links between sections working
- ✅ Export functionality unaffected

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing reports continue to work normally
- ✅ Single-author repositories unaffected
- ✅ No breaking changes to API or output structure

## Files Modified

- **`src/output/html.ts`**
  - Added `mergeAuthorsByEmail()` method
  - Modified `generateDetailedAuthorProfiles()` to use merging
  - Updated author table generation for consistency

- **`test/html-exporter.test.ts`**
  - Added comprehensive test for email merging functionality
  - Verifies merge behavior and output formatting

## Build & Test Results

**TypeScript Compilation:** ✅ Clean build (v1.0.62)  
**Test Suite:** ✅ All HTML exporter tests passing (12/12)  
**New Test:** ✅ Email merging test validates functionality  
**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ Existing tests continue to pass

## Usage Notes

The email normalization and merging happens automatically during HTML report generation. No configuration changes are needed. Users will see:

1. **Cleaner Reports:** Duplicate authors automatically merged
2. **Consistent Emails:** All displayed in lowercase format  
3. **Accurate Metrics:** Combined statistics reflecting true contributions
4. **Better UX:** Single profile per person with proper name display

This enhancement particularly benefits teams where developers:

- Use corporate email addresses with mixed case formatting
- Have Git configs with different email cases across machines
- Commit from different environments with varying email formats

The implementation ensures data accuracy while maintaining the clean, professional appearance of GitSpark HTML reports.
