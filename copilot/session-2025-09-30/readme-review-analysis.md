# README.md Review Analysis

## Summary

After reviewing the codebase and README.md, I found several features documented that are not fully implemented or need clarification.

## Issues Found

### 1. Unimplemented CLI Features

- **Watch mode** (`--watch`): CLI option exists but no implementation in core
- **Branch comparison** (`--compare <branch>`): CLI option exists but no implementation in core
- These should be removed from current documentation and moved to roadmap

### 2. Feature Status Clarifications Needed

- **Heavy analysis with temporal coupling**: Partially implemented but needs verification
- **Configuration file support**: Basic structure exists but full implementation unclear
- **Email redaction**: Implemented but needs testing verification

### 3. Documentation Accuracy

- Version numbers may need updating
- Some features may be over-promised in current capabilities
- Roadmap items may have incorrect version assignments

## Recommendations

1. **Remove unimplemented features** from current documentation
2. **Move premature features** to appropriate roadmap sections  
3. **Verify all documented features** have working implementations
4. **Update version information** to match package.json
5. **Clarify implementation status** for partially completed features

## Next Steps

- Update README.md to reflect only implemented features
- Move unimplemented features to roadmap with correct version targets
- Add disclaimers for experimental/beta features
