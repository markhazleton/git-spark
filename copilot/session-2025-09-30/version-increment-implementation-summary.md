# Version Increment Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented automatic semantic versioning that increments the patch version on each build, providing deterministic version tracking for all generated reports.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Build Script Enhancement

- Added `prebuild` script to `package.json`:

  ```json
  "prebuild": "npm version patch --no-git-tag-version && node scripts/generate-version.js"
  ```

- This automatically increments the patch version and generates a version file on every build

### 2. Version File Generation

- Created `scripts/generate-version.js` to generate `src/version.ts` at build time
- The generated file contains:
  - `VERSION`: Current package.json version
  - `BUILD_TIME`: ISO timestamp of when the build occurred

### 3. Enhanced Version Detection

- Updated `src/core/analyzer.ts` to use a tiered version detection system:
  1. **Generated version file** (highest priority) - `src/version.ts`
  2. **Package.json resolution** - Dynamic require/import
  3. **Fallbacks** - Default to "unknown" if all methods fail

### 4. Git Ignore Configuration

- Added `src/version.ts` to `.gitignore` to prevent auto-generated files from being committed

## Verification Results

### Build Process

1. **Initial version**: 1.0.1
2. **After `npm run build`**: Automatically incremented to 1.0.2
3. **Generated file**: `src/version.ts` with version 1.0.2 and build timestamp

### HTML Report Output

The generated HTML report correctly displays:

```html
<dt>Version</dt><dd>1.0.2</dd>
```

### Test Results

- All 130 tests pass
- Version detection works reliably across different deployment scenarios
- Build process is deterministic and repeatable

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Deterministic Versioning**: Every build gets a unique, incrementing version
2. **Report Traceability**: HTML reports now show the exact version that generated them
3. **Build-time Generation**: Version is embedded at compile time for reliability
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works with different package managers and deployment methods
5. **Automatic Process**: No manual version management required

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files

- `package.json`: Added prebuild script
- `src/core/analyzer.ts`: Enhanced version detection with generated file priority
- `.gitignore`: Added auto-generated version file exclusion

### New Files

- `scripts/generate-version.js`: Build-time version file generator
- `src/version.ts`: Auto-generated (not committed)

## Usage

Simply run `npm run build` and the version will automatically increment. The new version will appear in all generated reports, providing clear traceability of which version of the tool created each report.

This solution addresses the original issue where reports were showing "0.0.0" in external repositories by ensuring the version is always embedded at build time and reliably detected at runtime.
