## üîÑ Latest Update: Repository Lifetime Capping Implementation

**Implementation Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Task:** Automatic capping of analysis date ranges to repository lifetime

### Summary

Successfully implemented logic to automatically adjust analysis date ranges when they exceed the repository's actual lifetime. For example, requesting 10 days of analysis on a 3-day-old repository now automatically adjusts to 3 days with clear user notification.

### Changes Made

#### 1. New Git Utility Method

- **File:** `src/utils/git.ts`
- **Method:** `getFirstCommitDate(branch = 'HEAD'): Promise<Date | null>`
- **Purpose:** Efficiently retrieve the date of the first commit in the repository

#### 2. Date Range Adjustment Logic

- **File:** `src/core/collector.ts`
- **Enhancement:** Added automatic capping in `collectCommits()` method
- **User Communication:** Clear logging when adjustments occur

#### 3. Test Coverage

- **File:** `test/git-utils.test.ts`
- **Added:** 4 new test cases
- **Coverage:** All edge cases handled (empty repo, error conditions, branch-specific)

### Test Results

- **Previous:** 213 tests passing
- **Current:** 217 tests passing (+4)
- **Test Suites:** 13/13 passing
- **Status:** ‚úÖ All tests passing

### Example Behavior

**Scenario:** Repository is 3 days old, user requests 10 days

```bash
git-spark --days=10
```

**System Response:**

```
Analysis start date (2025-09-28) is before repository first commit (2025-10-05). 
Adjusting range to repository lifetime.
```

**Result:** Analysis runs for 3 days with accurate metrics

### Key Benefits

1. **Accuracy** - Metrics always reflect actual repository data
2. **Transparency** - Users informed when adjustments occur  
3. **No Errors** - Graceful handling of invalid date ranges
4. **Performance** - Minimal overhead (single Git command)
5. **Robustness** - Handles edge cases gracefully

### Files Modified

1. `src/utils/git.ts` - Added `getFirstCommitDate()` method
2. `src/core/collector.ts` - Added date range capping logic
3. `test/git-utils.test.ts` - Added 4 new test cases

### Documentation Created

1. `repository-lifetime-capping-implementation.md` - Comprehensive technical documentation

### Alignment with Git Spark Principles

This implementation perfectly aligns with Git Spark's core principle of **absolute honesty about data limitations** by preventing analyses that extend beyond repository existence and providing transparent communication about adjustments.
