## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### Preserve Core Strengths

1. **Never compromise on analytical integrity** - This is your competitive moat
2. **Maintain security-first approach** - Essential for enterprise
3. **Keep performance high** - Add benchmarks to prevent regression
4. **Continue excellent documentation** - Key differentiator

### Growth Strategy

1. **Enterprise Focus** - Target compliance/audit teams
2. **Platform Integrations** - Close feature gap with competitors
3. **Community Building** - Grow contributor base
4. **Marketing** - Emphasize trust through honesty

### Avoid These Pitfalls

1. **Feature Creep** - Adding features without platform integration first
2. **Overselling Capabilities** - Would destroy analytical integrity USP
3. **Neglecting Performance** - Critical for large repo users
4. **Poor Documentation** - Would hurt adoption
