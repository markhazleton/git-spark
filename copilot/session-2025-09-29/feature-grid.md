## Summary

Phase 3 objectives delivered: multi-series timeline, advanced visualizations, export capabilities, pagination, adaptive dark-mode chart theming, and accessibility enhancements. Remaining high-value roadmap items include: temporal coupling, deeper governance & distribution analytics, drill-down interactions, virtualization for very large datasets, comparison mode UI, and performance regression tooling.

## Recommended Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement comparison mode UI (base vs compare branch) leveraging existing types.
2. Add table search/filter for authors/files.
3. Introduce ownership distribution & entropy visualization.
4. Add commit message classification breakdown (types/scopes) if conventional patterns available.
5. Add performance regression script + optional large repo fixture harness.
6. Implement virtualization (IntersectionObserver + row windowing) for big tables.
7. Expose language breakdown chart.
8. Add minimal CSP hash regression test to prevent accidental inline additions.
