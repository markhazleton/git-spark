- ✅ Integration with analyzer for both Git history and current repository state
- ✅ All 12 gitignore tests passing
- ✅ Real-world verification confirmed (167 source files vs thousands with ignored files)

## Next Steps

The Git Spark project is now up-to-date with the latest compatible package versions. All functionality including the recently implemented gitignore support continues to work perfectly. The project is ready for:

- Continued development
- Production deployment
- NPM publishing (when ready)

No breaking changes were introduced, and all existing features remain stable and tested.
