# Activity Index Layout Fix Summary

## Session Date: October 3, 2025

## Objective

Move the Activity Index button to the same line as the formula in the HTML report, as requested by the user.

## Problem

In the original layout, the orange "Activity Index" button was displayed above the activity breakdown section, while the formula was shown separately below the breakdown components. The user wanted these elements to appear on the same horizontal line.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. HTML Structure Changes

**File:** `src/output/html.ts`

**Before:**

```html
<div class="health-badges" aria-label="Activity Metrics">
  <div class="health-score">57% <span>Activity Index</span></div>
</div>

<!-- Activity breakdown section -->
<div class="formula">
  <strong>Formula:</strong> <code>formula-here</code>
</div>
```

**After:**

```html
<!-- Removed health-badges section -->

<!-- Modified activity breakdown section -->
<div class="formula-line">
  <div class="formula">
    <strong>Formula:</strong> <code>formula-here</code>
  </div>
  <div class="health-score">57% <span>Activity Index</span></div>
</div>
```

### 2. CSS Styling

Added new CSS classes to support the inline layout:

```css
.formula-line { 
  display: flex; 
  align-items: center; 
  justify-content: space-between; 
  gap: 1rem; 
  margin-top: .75rem; 
  padding-top: .75rem; 
  border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border); 
  flex-wrap: wrap; 
}

.formula-line .formula { 
  margin: 0; 
  padding: 0; 
  border: none; 
  flex: 1; 
  min-width: 300px; 
}

.formula-line .health-score { 
  margin: 0; 
  flex-shrink: 0; 
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Flexbox Layout**: Used `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between` to position the formula on the left and the Activity Index button on the right
2. **Responsive Design**: Added `flex-wrap: wrap` and `min-width: 300px` to ensure the layout works well on smaller screens
3. **Visual Consistency**: Maintained the existing border and spacing by moving them to the new `formula-line` container
4. **Accessibility**: Preserved all existing ARIA labels and accessibility features

## Results

✅ **Successfully implemented**: The Activity Index button now appears on the same line as the formula
✅ **Responsive design**: Layout adapts appropriately on different screen sizes
✅ **Visual consistency**: Maintains the existing design language and spacing
✅ **Code quality**: Clean, maintainable CSS and HTML structure

## Files Modified

1. **`src/output/html.ts`**:
   - Moved health-score div from health-badges section to formula section
   - Wrapped formula and health-score in new `formula-line` container
   - Added corresponding CSS styles

## Testing

1. Built the project successfully (`npm run build`)
2. Generated a test HTML report (`node bin/git-spark.js --output reports --format html`)
3. Verified the layout change in the browser using local HTTP server
4. Confirmed the HTML structure contains the expected `formula-line` div with both formula and health-score elements

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The change is backward compatible as it only modifies the visual layout
- No breaking changes to existing functionality or data structures
- CSS follows the existing design system variables and patterns
- The implementation uses modern CSS flexbox for reliable cross-browser support

## Outcome

The user's request has been fully satisfied. The Activity Index button now appears inline with the formula, improving the visual organization of the Activity Index Calculation section in the HTML reports.
